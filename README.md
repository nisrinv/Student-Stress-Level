# Student-Stress-Level
1. The objective of this project is to analyze the root causes contributing to student stress by examining key factors such as psychological, physiological, environmental, academic, and social aspects. Understanding these underlying causes is essential to identify the main areas affecting students' mental well-being and to provide targeted support where it's most needed.

2. The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle and includes various attributes related to student stress indicators. A predictive model was developed using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify students' stress levels based on these factors. The insights gained from this model can help educational institutions and mental health professionals better support students by addressing the most influential stressors.
